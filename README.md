# friend-finder
In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application, the app allows a user to be matched with someone with similar interests based on a survey. This full-stack site will take in results from users' survey, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

In this app I used Express to handle routing. And I deployed the app to Heroku platform so other users can look at it on the web and interact with it.

The survey has 10 questions. Each answer should be on a scale of 1 to 5 (Never-Always) based on the frequency that the user has had depending on the question. The values I used for the app are as follows: 1-Never, 2-Hardly ever, 3-Sometimes, 4 Often and a 5 for selecting Always.

## Tecnologies:
Materialize, Heroku, Express, Node.
